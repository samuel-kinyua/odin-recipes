    <p>Matumbo can be prepared in a variety of ways. Nothing beats the pure bliss of thyme habanero matumbo with your favorite traditional mboga (let's face it, traditional veggies are better than anything else!!). and some hot ugali and sour milk (maziwa mala).</p> 
    <p>This is recipe is one of kenya's most  popular delicacies.It is easy to prepare for both exprienced and amature cooks. It best served for lunch or dinner.</p>
    <h1>Ingridients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large red onion, diced,</li>
            <li>large tomato, grated</li> 
            <li>bunch of dania (both stems and leaves will be used)</li>
            <li>2 kg matumbo</li> 
            <li>½ tsp thyme</li> 
            <li>½ tsp habanero</li> 
            <li>1 tbsp rocyo</li> 
            <li>salt to tast</li> 
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li> 
            <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li> 
            <li> 1 cup plain yoghurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the matumbo. It is a messy job, but since we are not scared of anything, we do it like the troopers we are! #KNationRocks! Wash the matumbo until the water runs clear! Absolutely no residue. That is how you know it is clean and ready for the next step: boiling.
        </li>
        <li>After the matumbo have boiled and are tender, set them aside. I often get asked, “How long should I boil matumbo for for them to be tender?” Well, you do not boil them until it is done,but you go further and boil it until it is tender. On a jiko, that will take 3-5 hours depending on your quantities. So stay alert and keep adding water. The longer you boil, the more tender it will become. If you have a pressure cooker, even better! It will take less time than a jiko but make sure you check from time to time so that they do not turn to shreds. If you have a slow cooker, an over night simmer will give you spectacularly tender matumbo.</li>
        <li>In a sufuria, add the red onion, garlic, thyme, and dania stems and let them cook for about 5 minutes till the onions have softened and fragrant. I used dried thyme that I bought from tuskys at 60 bob a can, but fresh thyme would work just as well. Besides matumbo, thyme goes really well with mbuzi, lamb, and any pulse.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and the chilli. I used the yellow habanero chilli by Kez Organics since it pairs so so so well with matumbo and pretty much everything else. It is really potent as well, and a little goes a long way. It will last a long time.  Check out their page to see how you can get some for yourself too. If you are in a matumbo emergency i.e. you want to make it noooooooooooow and cannot wait for a delivery, fresh chillies from mama mboga will work just fine.</li>
        <li>Once thickened, add the matumbo and mix in. At this point, you can add a bit of water according to the amount of soup you personally prefer to have in your matumbo. I like mine as a dry fry, so half a cup of hot water was sufficient. </li>
        <li>Allow to simmer for about 10 minutes on high heat then add the plain yoghurt. The plain yoghurt makes the stew thick and also tempers the heat of the habanero chili. Simmer for another twenty minutes this time on low. Turn off the heat then add the dania leaves. Remember, it is always dania leaves at the end as your garnish and dania stems together with onions at the beginning</li>
    <p>serve with some hot ugali and a glass of maziwa mala.</p>
